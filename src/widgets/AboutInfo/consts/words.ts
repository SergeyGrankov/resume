  I am a React Frontend developer with strong skills and knowledge for
  working in a team. I write code independently (seeking advice from
  colleagues when needed), I am hardworking, always striving for
  improvement, ambitious, and have strong communication skills. I value
  rational and well-grounded decision-making processes, and I absolutely
  love web development.
  \nMy experience is 2 years of commercial development, and before that I
  was interested in studying my specialty for another 1 year.
